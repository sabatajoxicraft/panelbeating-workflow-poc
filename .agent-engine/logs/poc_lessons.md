## Recommendations for Phase 2 (Semi-Automated)

### High Priority
1. **Automate first:**
   - 
   - 
   - 

2. **Keep manual for now:**
   - 
   - 
   - 

### Technical Approach
- **Language:** Python or Node.js?
- **Orchestration:** LangGraph or CrewAI first?
- **LLM Access:** GitHub Copilot API or CLI?

### Quality Gates
- Which gates should have human approval?
- Which can be fully automated?

---

## Framework Improvements

### Documentation
- What was unclear in the framework docs?
- What additional templates are needed?

### Agent Roles
- Are 9 agents the right number?
- Should any be combined or split?

### Workflow
- Did the 6-stage workflow make sense?
- Should any stages run differently?

---

## Next Steps

After completing this POC:
1. Update framework docs based on lessons learned
2. Create agent prompt templates
3. Build orchestrator script (Phase 2)
4. Test on second project to validate pattern
